# TLS-Compatibility-Checker
```
1.	Prerequisites: 
•	nmap
•	Python3 

2.	Working:
The script lets you test the IP addresses for the compatibility with TLS v1.0, v1.1, v1.2. The IP addresses can be given in 3 ways:
•	Single IP (64.124.29.1)
•	IP range (64.124.29.1 - 64.124.29.100)
•	File containing list of IP addresses 

The script will create a .txt file containing all the IP’s found compatible with TLS 1.0 in the same directory as that of the script.
